        <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about how much happiness you bring into my life. Every moment we share is precious to me, and I truly love every second we spend together. When we’re apart, I find myself missing you more than I can express. I love you deeply, and it feels like everything just falls into place when I’m with you. I know I’m not perfect—I make mistakes and have my flaws, but I want you to know that I’m constantly working on myself to be the best person I can be for you. Every word you say, every smile you give, makes me so incredibly happy. It’s hard to capture everything you mean to me in words because honestly, the list of things I love about you goes on forever. I cherish you more than I can ever fully express, and I’m so grateful to have you in my life.</p>
